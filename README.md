# intel-oneAPI

#### Team Name - Neural Nexus
#### Problem Statement - Develop a system to automatically generate audio content in the style of a podcast, utilizing the prompt provided  with the aim of producing engaging and informative conversations
#### Team Leader Email - balanshai123@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:
The prototype aims to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated podcast generator. It will accept user prompts and utilize several apis to gather relevant information from sources like Wikipedia. A large language model will then summarize the retrieved data, generating conversational-style content. The output will be in audio format, mimicking a podcast, with synthesized voices engaging in a discussion based on the provided prompt and summarized information.
